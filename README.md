# Plant_Seedlings_Classification
Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?
The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.
We are provided with a training set and a test set of images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo.
